<h3>This is the finale part of this guide. This part we will be working the tickets, in this case simulating working them. You will create, respond, and set the SLA for the tickets. You can also practice responding to the clints and simulate what it would be like in a real work environment.   </h3>

<p align="center">
First thing to do is to make your way to the support center page. Here you can make the tickets. To summerize this page you can make the tickets put the name for the client and detail regarding the issue they might be having. Follow these steps and feel free to experiment.: 
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
 For this the imformation can be random unless you want to test what the email features are like for osTicket. In this case we will make it random just to be able to make the ticket for this guide.:
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
After you make the ticket sign back in as an agent.:
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Sign%20in%20as%20a%20agent.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
<br />
<br />
Here you should be able to see the ticket that was made. You can set the SLA for it and put it in the correct catagory for the help topic. This will make it easier to place in the right department. we will work the ticket and make any corrections if any are needed, if the ticket is for this agent's department then he will work it and if not he will get comfirmation to send it to the correct place. Follow the steps.  :
<br />
<br /> 
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Working%20the%20ticket.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
 <br />
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Working%20the%20ticket%201.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
<br /> 
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Ticket%20work%202.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
<br />  
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Ticket%20work%204.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\ 
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/ticket%20work%203.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\  
<br />
<br />
Here I will make some corrections to the ticket the client submitted, this is something I think is pretty commone sometimes the info might not be submitted in the correct manner so we will make the corrections and send the ticket to the right department.:
<br />
<br /> 
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Wrong%20info%20put%20into%20the%20system%20.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
<br /> 
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/correction%20of%20the%20wrong%20info..PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
<br />
<br /> 
Now I will reasign the ticket to jane's department, when this happens John won't be able to see it anymore because he isn't a admin or apart of the department:
<br />
<br /> 
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/reassign.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
<br />
<br />
Now jane will be working the ticket replying to the client and fixing any issues she can find. After she is done working the ticket she will mark it as closed. Throughout the process she kept the customer informed on the matter. This is important to do if something is taking a long to to fix. This is also good to do if you are working in a team.:
<br />
<br />

<br /> 
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Jane%20working%20ticket.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
<br /> 
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Jane%20working%20ticket%20.PNG?raw=true" height="90%" width="80%"  />\
<br /> 
<img src="https://github.com/Kenron-Robinson/ticket-lifecycle/blob/main/Images/Ending%20ticket%20jane.PNG?raw=true" height="50%" width="40%"  />\
<br />
<br /> 

<h2>This concludes the guide, I hope this gives you a simple feel of how to use the ticketing system. Keep in mind that you might be working with a team and with how alot of ticketing systems are you can ask for help from others with the systems that are in place.I hope this guide serve as reference for the basic use of osTicket.</h2>
