<h3>This is the finale part of this guide. This part we will be working the tickets, in this case simulating working them. You will create, respond, and set the SLA for the tickets. You can also practice responding to the clints and simulate what it would be like in a real work environment.   </h3>

First thing to do is to make your way to the support center page. Here you can make the tickets. To summerize this page you can make the tickets put the name for the client and detail regarding the issue they might be having. Follow these steps and feel free to experiment.:

<br />
 For this the imformation can be random unless you want to test what the email features are like for osTicket. In this case we will make it random just to be able to make the ticket for this guide.:

<br />
<br />
After you make the ticket sign back in as an agent.:
<br />

<br />
<br />
Here you should be able to see the ticket that was made. You can set the SLA for it and put it in the correct catagory for the help topic. This will make it easier to place in the right department.  :

<br />
<br /> 
Here I will make some corrections to the ticket the client submitted, this is something I think is pretty commone sometimes the info might not be submitted in the correct manner so we will make the corrections and send the ticket to the right department.:
